# Uber-Power-Bi-Dashboard
This project is a 5-page interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze Uber’s operational performance across revenue, vehicles, riders, locations, and customer behavior. It converts raw booking data into insights that support strategic decision-making on fleet allocation, pricing, customer retention, and service optimization.
